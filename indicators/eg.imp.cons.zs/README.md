Net energy imports are estimated as gross imports less gross exports, both measured in tons of oil equivalents (toe). A negative value indicates that the country is a net exporter. Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport.
