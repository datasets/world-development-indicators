PPPs convert different currencies to a common currency and, in the process of conversion, equalize their purchasing power by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries, thereby allowing volume or output comparisons of gross domestic product (GDP) and its expenditure components. This conversion factor is for the level of GDP and the base currency is the US dollar.",
