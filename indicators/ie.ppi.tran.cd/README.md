The Private Participation In Infrastructure (PPI) Database records contractual arrangements for public infrastructure projects in low- and middle-income countries (as classified by the World Bank) that have reached financial closure, in which private parties assume operating risk. Investment in transport projects with private participation refers to commitments to infrastructure projects in transport [(a) airport runways and terminals, (b) railways (including fixed assets, freight, intercity passenger, and local passenger); (c) toll roads, bridges, highways, and tunnels, (d) port infrastructure, superstructures, terminals, and channels)] that have reached financial closure and directly or indirectly serve the public.  The types of projects included are management and lease contracts, brownfield projects, greenfield projects (in which a private entity or a public-private joint venture builds and operates a new facility), and divestitures. Investments are classified as one of two types: (1) Investments in physical assets: resources the project company commits to invest in expanding and modernizing facilities and (2) payments to the government: to acquire state-owned enterprises or rights to provide services in a specific area or to use radio spectrum.
