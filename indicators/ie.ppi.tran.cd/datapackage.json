Investment in transport projects with private participation refers to commitments to infrastructure projects in transport [(a) airport runways and terminals, (b) railways (including fixed assets, freight, intercity passenger, and local passenger); (c) toll roads, bridges, highways, and tunnels, (d) port infrastructure, superstructures, terminals, and channels)] that have reached financial closure and directly or indirectly serve the public.  The types of projects included are management and lease contracts, brownfield projects, greenfield projects (in which a private entity or a public-private joint venture builds and operates a new facility), and divestitures. Investments are classified as one of two types: (1) Investments in physical assets: resources the project company commits to invest in expanding and modernizing facilities and (2) payments to the government: to acquire state-owned enterprises or rights to provide services in a specific area or to use radio spectrum.
