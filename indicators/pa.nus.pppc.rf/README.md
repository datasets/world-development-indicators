The price level ratio, or price level index, is the ratio of a purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor to the corresponding market exchange rate between two countries. For this series the base country is the United States. It provides a measure of the differences in price level between the country and the United States by indicating the number of units of the common currency (US dollars)  needed to buy the same volume of the aggregation level in each country. At the level of GDP, the price level ratio provides a measure of the differences in the general price levels of countries.
